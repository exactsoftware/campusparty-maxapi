            "history": "For almost two decades, Albert Park traditionally hosts the opening Grand Prix of the Formula 1 World Championship. (Non) Championship Grand Prix racing can be traced back to the early ‘50s with Stirling Moss among the winners. However, it was not until Jeff Kennett became premier of the State of Victoria in 1992, that efforts were made to move the Australian Grand Prix from Adelaide to Melbourne. Kennet negotiated a deal with F1 supremo Bernie Ecclestone and an agreement was reached in 1993. Nevertheless,  the first event did not happen until the contract with Adelaide expired in 1996. Rebuilding Albert Park caused opposition and protests but the first race was a success.",
            "qoute": "The biggest challenge that Albert Park offers is the first corner. It’s very bumpy and it’s easy to lock up the front wheels. I like that the track is partially a street course with not a lot of run-off."

Overtaking is only possible in a few places. All of this, however, makes this Grand Prix special.

Apart from several minor changes in the 70s and 80s, it was not until the 90s that the track underwent a major reconfiguration. The main aim of the alterations were to transform the ultra-fast course into a more technical circuit. In 2010, another major revamp was undertaken in which five of the original corners disappeared and were replaced by six new ones. A year later, the start/finish line was relocated to another straight. Alongside the new starting grid, a new pit complex was build, with the 'old' pits still used by several championships.",

In these early years, Mercedes-Benz used it as a test track. In 1938, the track was shortened to 4.7 miles and was named the Kurpfalzring. Nine years later, it inherited its current and more famous name. In 1965, a new motorway, the Bundesautobahn 6, split the track in two. Therefore, the circuit was shortened to 4.24 miles. The modification also included the famous 'Motodrom' stadium section. After F1 legend Jim Clark was killed in a Formula 2 racing accident, two fast chicanes were added to the track in 1968.  Nevertheless, the new Hockenheimring remained, together with Monza, one of the fastest Formula 1 tracks and retained its lay-out for over three decades. Lowering the immense speeds and increasing the opportunities to overtake, were among the reasons to reconfigure the track to its current lay-out in 2002. The new circuit, redesigned by Hermann Tilke, was shortened to 2.8 miles and together with the Nürburgring, Hockenheim hosts the German round of the Formula 1 championship.",

Two years after WWII, the track was slightly shortened to 8.7 miles, still maintaining the characteristics of the pre-war circuit. The first major change to the lay-out was made in 1979 when the track was shortened to 4.330 miles. This configuration consisted partially of public roads. Only in between the corners 'Les Combes' and 'Blanchimont', the track was exclusively used for racing. However, at the turn of the century, Spa-Francorchamps became a permanently closed circuit as a new public road was built at the east of the track. The most recent change was the implementation of a new 'Bus Stop Chicane' and a new pit lane. Regardless of the track variations throughout the years, the track remains a favourite among both drivers and fans.",

After the Second World War, the circuit was revamped resulting in a 3.5-mile course as well as a new 2.6-mile banked oval. The two tracks were combined to create a 6.2-mile circuit that was used in ’55, ’56, ’60 and ’61. Due to the tragic fatal accident of Wolfgang von Trips in 1961, the use of the oval ended. All future F1 races would take place on the main circuit that, apart from a few changes to the chicanes, retained its high-speed nature. Thus far, 75 Grand Prix have been driven at Monza, more than any other race track. And with the exception of 1980, the venue has hosted the Italian round of the formula 1 world Championship on annual basis.",

The modern, 5.540 meters long track with an average width of 16 meters, is impressive because of the large grandstands. They both have a fast straight on each side which means that the cars actually have to drive around them. The circuit is very popular with the drivers and, moreover, is very safe. The track was officially inaugurated in March 1999 and the first Malaysian Grand Prix was held in the same year. The race ended in a one-two victory for Ferrari with Eddie Irvine crossing the line first.",

In the second sector you can really make a difference, because that is the technical part, where you need to drive with your head on. It is also important, as a result of the Malaysian climate, to take extra care of your tyres, because they take a pounding."

You'll need a lot of traction and a car that absorbs the kerbstones well. The fast turns are definitively the best part. The stadium section is also nice, it's really cool to drive through. But it's better not to overtake there because it will give the other driver the advantage of DRS on the long straight. So it's better to stay behind and then try to overtake them on the straight."

The present design of the track dates back to 1990, when the original circuit was shortened from 4.8 miles to only 2.7 miles. Despite the major revamp, the circuit still kept some of its key characteristics such as the many bumps in the tarmac, the elevation changes and several high-speed turns.",
