<title>Max" fourth in Melbourne FP1: "Not bad"</title>
<guid><![CDATA[http://www.verstappen.nl/en/article/2831/]]></guid>
<description><![CDATA[<p>Max Verstappen finished the first session of the 2017 Formula 1 World Championship in fourth. In the beautiful, sunny Albert Park in Melbourne Australia, the Dutchman clocked a 1:25.2 on the super-softs. Lewis Hamilton was quickest (1:24.220) followed by Mercedes team mate Valtteri Bottas. Daniel Ricciardo completed the top four.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The first session wasn&rsquo;t bad. I think we&rsquo;re near the front&rdquo;, says Max to Verstappen.nl. &ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t able to do many laps in the opening part of the session because of a small issue with the starter motor. But after that, we did a run on the super-softs. We know those tyres peak in the first lap, but I was also still finding my way, getting used to car and new speeds. The balance was al right, but we can work at it in FP2.&rdquo;</p>

<title>Video: Dinghy dash Down Under</title>
<guid><![CDATA[http://www.verstappen.nl/en/article/2827/]]></guid>
<description><![CDATA[<p>It&rsquo;s almost time for the season to get underway but before attention turns to Albert Park and the Australian Grand Prix, Max Verstappen and Daniel Ricciardo got to enjoy a little bit of downtime, messing about in boats on Melbourne&rsquo;s Yarra River.</p>

<p>With the Melbourne skyline and iconic Flinders Street Station providing the backdrop, the boys spent Wednesday morning at the Richmond Rowing Club in the company of professional dinghy racers Scott Jenke and Jeremy Newman. This isn&rsquo;t the sort of genteel wind-powered dinghy racing many people will be familiar with but rather its outboard-powered fast-and-furious antipodean cousin, in which the ultra-manoeuvrable 3m aluminium skiffs, supplied by the Riverland Dinghy Club, can reach speeds of 90kph. This is high-speed racing in crash helmets &ndash; so naturally Max and Daniel were eager to get out on the water.</p>

<title>Max gives a behind the scenes for his fans</title>
<guid><![CDATA[http://www.verstappen.nl/en/article/2826/]]></guid>
<description><![CDATA[<p>Yesterday Max Verstappen was present at the DIY-giant Hornbach in Amsterdam. Apart from the many interviews, a look back at his first year at Red Bull Racing and a preview of the coming season, Max treated the many fans, who came out in droves, and Formula 1-reporter Jack Plooij to a behind the scenes of the sport.</p>

<p>For starters, there is a brief looking back at the testing of the full wet tyres during the pre-season Winter test in Barcelona. The circuit was made&nbsp;intentionally&nbsp;wet. &ldquo;It is of course not the same as a rainy day, like today. It also didn&rsquo;t feel quite right on the new full wets. They&rsquo;re broader and in the rain that is far from ideal&nbsp;because they can cause more wheel spin. When there is a lot of water, you can feel that from the tyres. They still need to work on that.&rdquo;</p>

<guid><![CDATA[http://www.verstappen.nl/en/article/2825/]]></guid>
<description><![CDATA[<p>Max Verstappen is present today at Hornbach in Amsterdam. This is a unique possibility for fans to meet Max, before he heads off to Australia where the first Grand Prix of the season will take place next week. Apart from the countless autographs that Max will be signing today, the Dutchman will also do some interviews the massive crowd will be able to listen to.</p>

<p>Max appreciates the huge interest very much: &ldquo;It is very nice to see so many fans and also that they showed up. It is also good to see that it&rsquo;s so very much alive in the Netherlands.&rdquo;</p>

<title>Max: "First race is always exciting"</title>
<guid><![CDATA[http://www.verstappen.nl/en/article/2824/]]></guid>
<description><![CDATA[<p>Looking ahead to the first Grand Prix of 2017, Max Verstappen says: &ldquo;We always arrive in Australia a bit early due to the time difference, this way we have a bit longer to acclimatise. The first two or three days you struggle with jetlag a bit but then it&#39;s fine because you are just really excited for the first race of the year.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I enjoy going to Melbourne as it&rsquo;s a cool city, nice environment and good weather so generally a great place to stay. I found some nice restaurants down by the Yarra River so whenever we have time I will head down there for some dinner.&rdquo;</p>

<title>Red Bull Racing: "Extremely difficult to form a really clear picture"</title>
<guid><![CDATA[http://www.verstappen.nl/en/article/2820/]]></guid>
<description><![CDATA[<p>Red Bull Racing head of race engineering Guillaume Rocquelin said after the last day of testing in Barcelona: &ldquo;As with Daniel on day one of this test, this morning we focused on short runs with Max and we were also able to do some performance work and put a reasonable lap time on the board. We had a little issue over lunch, but as on Tuesday, we wanted to get some longer runs done this afternoon, so it was worth sacrificing a bit of time to make sure the car would run smoothly. In terms of the tests as a whole, broadly speaking we&rsquo;ve achieved what we wanted to do. There were a few niggles but that&rsquo;s always the case with a new car and we knew how to manage those situations.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll now have a pretty intense couple of weeks before Melbourne &ndash; as every team will &ndash; digesting all the information, putting permanent fixes in place for the issues we found, and working on a plan of attack for the first race. Do I think we can be competitive? I think so. We&rsquo;re happy with the balance and happy with the performance. Some teams put in some impressive lap times but there are so many parameters at play in testing that it&rsquo;s extremely difficult to form a really clear picture of where everyone is.&rdquo;</p>

<title>Verstappen ends final pre-season test in P2: "Want and must keep improving"</title>
<guid><![CDATA[http://www.verstappen.nl/en/article/2819/]]></guid>
<description><![CDATA[<p>Max Verstappen finished the final day of pre-season testing, prior to the start of the season, in second. The 1:19.438 from the morning session, proved to be unbeatable after lunch for the Dutchman. An issue with the RB13&rsquo;s turbo kept Verstappen for quite a while in the garage in the afternoon. At the end of the afternoon, the issue was solved and the youngster still managed to pull off 38 laps. Bringing his total to 71 laps today. Kimi Raikkonen&rsquo;s time, a 1:18.634 set in the early session, was eventually the fastest time from the entire eight days of pre-season testing.</p>

<p>Are you worried about the problems? &ldquo;No, I am not worried. We test in order to put everything to the test and I am confident that Renault will be able to solve matters before Melbourne. It is not a major issue&rdquo;, Max explains to Verstappen.nl. &ldquo;It was for us the most important thing today to be able to check today&#39;s balance compared to that of yesterday&#39;s. It has certainly improved, but can always be better. It was a positive day. The performance is ok for now, but we want and of course must keep improving.&rdquo;</p>

<title>Max second during morning of final test day</title>
<guid><![CDATA[http://www.verstappen.nl/en/article/2818/]]></guid>
<description><![CDATA[<p>Max Verstappen finished the morning session of the final pre-season test day in second. His 1:19.438 was eight tenths slower than Ferrari&rsquo;s Kimi Raikkonen. The Finn topped the leader boards emphasizing the Scuderia&rsquo;s fine form in testing so far.</p>

<p>Lance Stroll (Williams) and Marcus Ericsson (Sauber) were the most productive drivers with 59 laps each on the board. Max managed 33 laps in Red Bull Racing&rsquo;s RB13.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It went reasonably well this morning&rdquo;, said Max to Verstappen.nl. The team mainly focused on shorter runs. &ldquo;We tried the soft compound. It felt okay. Of course there is room for improvement but we were able to run our program without any issues, which is the main thing. The practice starts went well too.&rdquo;</p>

<title>Red Bull Racing: "See what performance we can achieve"</title>
<guid><![CDATA[http://www.verstappen.nl/en/article/2817/]]></guid>
<description><![CDATA[<p>Red Bull Racing head of race engineering Guillaume Rocquelin said after Thursday in Barcelona: &ldquo;Today everything worked as it should and we were able to run as we wanted. Beyond that there&rsquo;s not much to say really: short runs in the morning, a race simulation in the afternoon, albeit slightly interrupted, the car behaved as we expected and we got through the full programme. All in all, it was a good day&rsquo;s work by the whole team. For tomorrow, our last day here in Barcelona, Max will take over driving duties and we&rsquo;ll try to mirror what we did with Daniel on day one of this week&rsquo;s test &ndash; so that will be some short runs, more test items to get through and hopefully at some point we&rsquo;ll see what performance we can achieve.&rdquo;</p>

<title>Ferrari on top on penultimate day pre-season testing</title>
<guid><![CDATA[http://www.verstappen.nl/en/article/2816/]]></guid>
<description><![CDATA[<p>Sebastian Vettel topped the leaderboard on the seventh and penultimate day of the pre-season winter testing in Barcelona. The time the Ferrari-driver clocked in the early session, was not bettered in the afternoon. Behind him, Lewis Hamilton and Esteban Ocon finished in second and third. Red Bull Racing ends the day with Daniel Ricciardo in P6. After experiencing some issues yesterday, the Ozzie managed to pull off 128 laps today</p>

<p>Today Ricciardo had the same schedule Max had: short runs in the morning and long ones in the afternoon. Guillaume Rocqueling, Red Bull Racing&rsquo;s chief race-engineering, indicated that yesterday.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am happy that it is over&rdquo;, says Ricciardo at the end of the test. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think we were particularly quick today, but in any case I am happy that I am in good shape. We didn&rsquo;t have any major issues today and I am happy with that. I have faith in the car, although we were much further a stray from our competitors today than we were last week. Anyway, the season starts in Melbourne and everything can be different once we get there. And yes, I do think that Ferrari is stronger at this moment.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We have made some progress but today didn&rsquo;t quite go as we wanted it to with regard to the set-up. That is evident on the leaderboard. Luckily Max will be driving tomorrow, so we will be able to get just that little bit more of data on the car. To be honest, I have had it with testing, I want to go racing!&rdquo;</p>

<title>Max Verstappen and Exact prolong their partnership</title>
<guid><![CDATA[http://www.verstappen.nl/en/article/2814/]]></guid>
<description><![CDATA[<p>Exact and Formula 1 driver Max Verstappen today announced the extension of the partnership between the two through to the end of 2019. The agreement was confirmed at the Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya, &#8203;&#8203;where Verstappen is currently testing in preparation for the upcoming season. In the 18 months since the Formula 1 driver and the technology company teamed up, both have developed tremendously within their respective fields. As a result, both are confident that the future relationship will see them continue to prosper.</p>

<p>&quot;The collaboration with Exact is outstanding, so I&#39;m very happy with our continued partnership. It&#39;s great to have a partner that is as passionate and ambitious as I am and that sees me as an example for its own employees and customers. The way they received me after my victory in Spain last year was unforgettable. My goal for this season is to give them a few more occasions for such celebrations,&quot; Verstappen added.</p>

<title>Max very positive after 102 laps: "Learned and acquired a lot"</title>
<guid><![CDATA[http://www.verstappen.nl/en/article/2813/]]></guid>
<description><![CDATA[<p>Max Verstappen has had once again a very productive day during the second pre-season test. Despite an engine change, which took a lot of time, the Dutchman drove an astonishing 102 laps and finished eventually in fourth on the leaderboard. The fastest driver was Valtteri Bottas, on the super-softs the Mercedes-driver clocked a 1:19.310. The fastest time set so far during this pre-season winter test. Felipe Massa followed on the ultra-soft tyre with a little over a tenth.<br />
<br />
Just before the end of the session, Max had to park his RB13 alongside the track. Afterwards he explains to Verstappen.nl: &ldquo;We still need to figure out what caused it, but it looks like the same problem we had this morning. This is not ideal, but it&rsquo;s all part of it. I am confident that it will be solved very quickly. Renault has a solution for Melbourne, so it should be alright.&rdquo;</p>

<title>Red Bull Racing: "Concentrated on long runs in the afternoon"</title>
<guid><![CDATA[http://www.verstappen.nl/en/article/2811/]]></guid>
<description><![CDATA[<p>Red Bull Racing head of race engineering Guillaume Rocquelin said after the Wednesday in Barcelona: &ldquo;In the morning we again looked at shorter runs and a number of test items, plus some pit stop practice so that the boys can get their eye in before the season starts. But then before lunch we noticed something in the data, and given that we wanted to concentrate on long runs in the afternoon and didn&rsquo;t want to take any risks, we decided to change the engine.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We lost some time but it was the right thing to do as we had a good afternoon and Max was able to work through the rest of the programme. We then encountered another problem right at the end of the day, which we&rsquo;re looking into. Not an ideal outing, as we would have liked to tick a few more items off the list, but Max got through more than 100 laps today, so we can&rsquo;t be too dissatisfied. We&rsquo;ll run a similar programme with Daniel tomorrow but hopefully without any issues.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

It didn&rsquo;t all go as planned. With a mere 34 laps it wasn&rsquo;t an all too productive morning for Red Bull Racing. Valtteri Bottas topped the board in his Mercedes (1:19.310), followed by Felipe Massa, who parked his Williams on the second spot.</p>

<p>After the morning session, Max has a chat with Verstappen.nl. &ldquo;Up until the issue everything was going smoothly. Things felt good. We were making different adjustments to get the car to perform better. We can be happy about that so far. Compared to last week, we are running a different test schedule, but I can notice some good progress.&rdquo;</p>

<description><![CDATA[<p>During the second pre-season test at Barcelona, Max Verstappen previewed the upcoming season at an event organized by his personal sponsor Exact. After being introduced by CEO Erik van der Meijden, Max shared his thoughts with the visitors.</p>

<p>&ldquo;At the moment, it&rsquo;s still difficult to judge where we are but we&rsquo;re feeling positive. Because the car is still so new, we&rsquo;re constantly developing. The engineers have a lot of new stuff to work with so the gains are bigger. Come Saturday in Melbourne, we&rsquo;ll really know where we are.&rdquo;</p>

<guid><![CDATA[http://www.verstappen.nl/en/article/2808/]]></guid>
<description><![CDATA[<p>The time Felipe Massa noted during the early session of the second pre-season test, has not been bettered during the afternoon.

<p>Daniel Ricciardo remained second, just like in the morning session, followed by Sebastian Vettel who demoted Lewis Hamilton to third. Ferrari were also making tracks. Just like Williams, their total score at the end of the day was an impressive 168 laps.</p>

<description><![CDATA[<p>Red Bull Racing head of race engineering Guillaume Rocquelin said after the Tuesday in Barcelona: &ldquo;I&rsquo;d call that a very productive day&rsquo;s work. In fact, it was pretty much working through the kind of programme we&rsquo;d normally run on a Friday of a race weekend &ndash; so, shorter runs in the morning to focus on working with tyre compounds and then longer runs in the afternoon.&rdquo;</p>

<title>Red Bull Racing: "In all, it was a good test"</title>
<guid><![CDATA[http://www.verstappen.nl/en/article/2803/]]></guid>
<description><![CDATA[<p>The final day of the first test in Barcelona marked a departure from the past three days&rsquo; activity, with the track being made wet in order to conduct testing of Pirelli&rsquo;s intermediate and full wet 2017 tyres. Max Verstappen took over driving duties from Daniel Ricciardo and after testing both wet weather compounds, the Dutchman also got in some dry running on the soft compound tyre to record the day&rsquo;s second fastest time with a lap of 1:21.769.</p>

<p>Red Bull Racing head of race engineering Guillaume Rocquelin said: &ldquo;While I don&rsquo;t imagine anyone would say the conditions today were perfect, as some parts of the track were dry and others wet, it was still a very interesting exercise. We&rsquo;re discovering new things all the time about the tyres and how they interact with the car &ndash; warm-up, degradation levels etc &ndash; so we did find out some things we wouldn&rsquo;t have unless we had been through this process.&nbsp;</p>

<title>Verstappen quick on wet morning track: "Not too bad"</title>
<guid><![CDATA[http://www.verstappen.nl/en/article/2802/]]></guid>
<description><![CDATA[<p>On a track that was getting drier by the minute, Max Verstappen had a productive morning session on Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya. With no less than 43 laps and a 1:23.920, good enough for fourth, there was no need to complain. The Dutchman dictated the tempo in the wet conditions while Kimi clocked the fastest time once the track got dry. Grosjean and Vandoorne followed in third and second.</p>

<p>Max tells Verstappen.nl after the session: &ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t too bad. With the wet track it was a bit different than usual. The track of course was not the same as yesterday, because there is little grip with the full wets, but we were able to do some decent testing.&rdquo;</p>

<title>Verstappen finishes pre-season testing in second: "Very positive"</title>
<guid><![CDATA[http://www.verstappen.nl/en/article/2801/]]></guid>
<description><![CDATA[<p>Max Verstappen has had a very productive day on the circuit of Barcelona. The Dutchman lapped the track some 43 times during the morning session on a track that was getting drier and drier. In the afternoon session, he added 42 more laps to the tally. A second place on the leaderboard brought out Max&#39; happy face and also from his team. Kimi Raikkonen managed to top the leaderboard today. The Fin was almost a second faster than Verstappen. The top five was rounded up by Palmer, Grosjean and Giovinazzi.</p>

<p>At the end of the day, Verstappen had the following to say regarding the wet conditions: &ldquo;It was slippery on track. For sure it is always good to be able to test on a wet circuit so you can get a feel for the full wets. The conditions are of course not ideal. The sun is shining while the track is wet. We now have a rough idea regarding the full wets. Compared to last year, you need to drive the car little bit different on the wet asphalt, but the car performed well.&rdquo;</p>

<title>Red Bull Racing after 3rd day: "Not ideal"</title>
<guid><![CDATA[http://www.verstappen.nl/en/article/2800/]]></guid>
<description><![CDATA[<p>Commenting on Wednesday&rsquo;s running, head of race engineering Guillaume Rocquelin said: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s obviously not ideal when you encounter the kind of issues we had today and on Monday, but that&rsquo;s the nature of testing. This afternoon we had an exhaust issue that hampered progress and it meant another tricky day for Daniel. It&rsquo;s unfortunate for him, as these issues manifested themselves on the days he was in the car, but he understands the nature of testing and he&rsquo;s actually pretty upbeat about how the car feels and how it&rsquo;s behaving.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ultimately it&rsquo;s about what you learn from the laps you do get on the board rather than just running for the sake of it and so we&rsquo;ve learned a lot so far. Tomorrow we&rsquo;ll learn even more as the track will be artificially wet, so plenty of work still to do before we head back to the factory.&rdquo;</p>

<title>Bottas quickest as Ferrari impress on third day of Barcelona test</title>
<guid><![CDATA[http://www.verstappen.nl/en/article/2799/]]></guid>
<description><![CDATA[<p>Valtteri Bottas was the fastest man on the third day of the first pre-season test at Barcelona. The Mercedes driver clocked a 1:19.705, leaving Ferrari&rsquo;s Sebastian Vettel two tenths adrift. After a productive morning, Red Bull Racing had a less fortunate afternoon with Daniel Ricciardo only completing 22 laps due to an exhaust issue. In the morning, the Australian managed 48 laps.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Today was better than the first test day&rdquo;, said Ricciardo, who finished the day in third. &ldquo;We drove more laps and learned more about the car and the tires. Unfortunately, we lost time due to exhaust issues but apart from that it was a good day.&rdquo;</p>

<title>Red Bull Racing satisfied about test day 2: "According to plan"</title>
<guid><![CDATA[http://www.verstappen.nl/en/article/2797/]]></guid>
<description><![CDATA[<p>After a pretty disappointing opening day of testing at Barcelona, the second day was a lot more positive for Red Bull Racing. Max Verstappen did 89 laps around the Circuito de Catalunya and posted the 3rd fastest time. Head of Race Engineering Guillaume Rocquelin commented after the session: &ldquo;After clearing the niggles we had yesterday, today went very much according to plan. We were a little tentative in the morning as it was pretty chilly and a few people were sliding around a bit. Because of that we focused on short runs and aero mapping.&nbsp;We then had a pretty long stop over lunch to make some changes to the car in preparation for what we wanted to achieve this afternoon.&nbsp;We knew it would mean taking a hit in terms of track time but we were willing to do that in order to get the information we wanted. And we did that. It&rsquo;s an interesting process this year.&quot;</p>

<p>Rocquelin furthermore elaborates on the challenges the new regulation bring: &quot;Obviously, the new cars behave quite differently to the last generation and therefore you can only draw so much on historical reference. As such these first couple of days are really about establishing a platform of understanding and once you have that you can really start to build from there. It&rsquo;s also been very interesting to work with the new tyres. The deg is good; they&rsquo;re consistent, they&rsquo;re a good step I think.&rdquo;</p>

<title>Max third on second test day: "It went well"</title>

<description><![CDATA[<p>Max enjoyed a good start to the 2017 Formula 1 season by finishing third on the second day of the first pre-season test in Barcelona. The Dutchman, who made his debut in the RB13, lapped the Spanish track 89 times setting a personal best of 1:22.200.</p>

<p>Kimi Raikkonen (Ferrari) topped the timing tables with a 1:20.960 on the soft tyre with Valtteri Bottas in the Mercedes making it a Finnish top two.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Today went well&rdquo;, explained Max after his first day of testing. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s too early to say how good we really are, but we were able to run our programme and I think we can be happy with today. We were able to do plenty of laps without many issues. We first tried the balance right, after which you start to try different stuff.&rdquo;</p>

<title>Mercedes and Ferrari on top after first day of testing</title>

<description><![CDATA[<p>Mercedes finished the first day of pre-season testing for the 2017 Formula 1 World Championship at the top of the table. After Valtteri Bottas drove in the morning session, Lewis Hamilton set the pace in the afternoon with the fastest lap of the day (1:21.765). The Mercedes driver&rsquo;s quickest effort was three seconds faster than the quickest time set on day one of the 2016 first pre-season test.</p>

<p>Sebastian Vettel, fastest in the morning session, continued Ferrari&rsquo;s strong form in the afternoon by setting the second quickest lap of the day. The German, on the medium Pirellis, was only a tenth shy of Hamilton&rsquo;s time, which was set on the soft compound. Felipe Massa (Williams) and Kevin Magnussen (Haas F1) completed the top four.</p>

<p>After a slow start to the day, with only four laps in the morning, Red Bull Racing&rsquo;s Daniel Ricciardo managed half a century of laps in the afternoon. Max Verstappen&rsquo;s team mate set the fifth quickest time of the day.</p>

<title>Vettel tops first morning, Red Bull limited to four laps</title>
<guid><![CDATA[http://www.verstappen.nl/en/article/2791/]]></guid>
<description><![CDATA[<p>Sebastian Vettel topped the leader boards after the first morning test session of 2017. The Ferrari driver lapped the Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya in a 1:22.781 on the soft Pirellis compound. Valtteri Bottas was the most productive driver of the morning. He completed 79 laps for his new team, Mercedes, without issues.</p>

<p>Red Bull Racing had a tough start to their first pre-season test. After four laps, Daniel Ricciardo was forced to return to the pits without his RB13. A sensor issue stopped the car, prompting the team to remove the gearbox. It meant the Australian would not take further part in the morning session.</p>

<p>Max Verstappen, who will drive the Red Bull on Tuesday, explained from the pits: &ldquo;In testing it&rsquo;s not about lap times. The goal is to drive as much as possible to get to know the car and to get a good feeling with it. It&rsquo;s a completely new car and we haven&rsquo;t driven in three months. So for us as drivers, we&rsquo;ll have to build up the speed gradually.&rdquo;</p>

<description><![CDATA[<p>Ahead of the RB13 running for the first time in Barcelona next week, we caught up with Max Verstappen to hear his views on the regulation changes, his goals for the 2017 season and the benefits of having a strong teammate.</p>

<p><strong>What are your goals for 2017?</strong><br />
&ldquo;First I want to see how competitive the car is and then I can be more precise on my goals. Of course I always want to win races, but you need to have the right equipment for that as well.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Can you carry the momentum on from 2016?</strong><br />
&ldquo;You just start from zero again. It&rsquo;s a completely different car, so hopefully we did build a very competitive car. We still have to wait and see. I&rsquo;m very confident that Red Bull can do a very good job as they have shown in the previous years.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>How is the mood in the team?</strong><br />
&ldquo;The mood is always very good, very positive, that is very nice to see in the team. Everybody is getting very excited to see the new car and hopefully it will perform well. Everybody is really looking forward to it.&rdquo;</p>

<title>Max reveals his new 2017 helmet</title>
<guid><![CDATA[http://www.verstappen.nl/en/article/2783/]]></guid>
<description><![CDATA[<p>Max Verstappen has revealed his brand new helmet for the 2017 Formula 1 World Championship. &ldquo;Us drivers are always trying to tweak our helmet design. As you can see it differs a bit with different colors. No orange for me this year, but both my sponsors are at the front.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because of the slightly bigger Red Bull logo on the side of the helmet &ndash; it&rsquo;s now more in line with the logo on the car &ndash; I had to adjust the design a bit further. Nevertheless the V is still there. I&rsquo;ve had it all my career.&rdquo;</p>

<title>Horner on 2017: his drivers, the RB13 and his expectations</title>
<guid><![CDATA[http://www.verstappen.nl/en/article/2781/]]></guid>
<description><![CDATA[<p><strong>On the brink of the 2017 Formula 1 World Championship, Christian Horner, Red Bull Racing&rsquo;s team boss, tells us where the team is at</strong>. &ldquo;In between seasons always has its moments of pressure and demands, but we&rsquo;re like a swan on the surface and paddling furiously underneath. It&rsquo;s the same every pre-season. But in generally speaking, we&rsquo;re pretty much on target.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Looking ahead, what are Horner&rsquo;s expectations for 2017?&nbsp;</strong><br />
&ldquo;We went into the winter on a real high. Momentum definitely build during the course of last year as we developed the car, raced well and proved strong strategic. But it&rsquo;s of course a clean sheet of paper for 2017. For any designer or engineer it is a really exciting challenge. A few years ago, in 2009, the double diffuser was the gizmo. Will there be one this time round and will we have missed it? Hopefully not and we&rsquo;ll be competitive.&rdquo;</p>

<guid><![CDATA[http://www.verstappen.nl/en/article/2780/]]></guid>
<description><![CDATA[<p>It&rsquo;s a lean time to be an F1 driver as they prep for what might be the most physically demanding F1 season of their career to date. Max, though, is more than up for the challenge. In fact, as he prepares for his first full pre-season with the team, he&rsquo;s raring to go..&nbsp;</p>

<p>The off-season is coming to a close. How good is it to be back with the team and getting ready for 2017? &quot;I&#39;m very happy to be back. I&#39;ve been busy with training since the beginning of the year, getting myself ready, and waiting for the car to be ready and then we&#39;ll get back on track, so looking forward to it.&quot;</p>

<title>Max: "We will see what happens in Monaco"</title>
<guid><![CDATA[http://www.verstappen.nl/?locatie=bericht&id=2514&lang=en]]></guid>
<description><![CDATA[<p>Max is looking forward to his second race for Red Bull Racing, in Monaco: &quot;I always enjoy racing street circuits like Monaco because you are really pushing the limit and are very close to the walls, it gives you a great feeling that you are on top of your car and getting the most out of it.&quot;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s so difficult to overtake in Monaco, last year I tried and we ended up in the wall, so the most important thing is to have a good qualifying and start and from there on keep it on the track! Monaco is also special because the track is walking distance from where I live so that&rsquo;s nice to feel like I&rsquo;m home during the race weekend.&nbsp;Naturally there is a lot more attention around driving the car but at the end the most important thing for the driver is just to focus on what you&rsquo;re doing.&quot;</p>

<title>Rocquelin of RBR: "Good program of work completed"</title>
<guid><![CDATA[http://www.verstappen.nl/?locatie=bericht&id=2512&lang=en]]></guid>
<description><![CDATA[<p>Max Verstappen took over in the Red Bull Racing RB12 for the second and final day of 2016&rsquo;s first in-season test. Max had a busy day at the Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya, completing 118 laps, running with tyres and a setup similar to those used for the Spanish Grand Prix at the weekend. He finished Wednesday P1 on the timesheet, 0.739s ahead of his nearest rival. Of much greater significance, he completed his program with no reliability issues.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Max carried on the aero development work started Tuesday by Daniel Ricciardo. His program, however, had the additional target of getting the driver comfortable in the car and comfortable with his crew. Despite having already won a Grand Prix in the RB12, Max is still getting to know the car, and thus the great benefit of the test day was allowing him to fine-tune his setup preferences and develop relationships with his engineers and crew.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I enjoyed it again today&rdquo;, Max shares with Verstappen.nl. &ldquo;We were able to do some very good mileage and the car is very good to drive.&rdquo;</p>

<description><![CDATA[<p>The smell of Champaign has been replaced for that of gasoline in the Red Bull Racing-pitbox by now. Max Verstappen&rsquo;s race-overall has also been freshly washed and the reinvigorated, brand new Grand Prix winner got himself ready for the second day of testing in Barcelona. Just like Sunday, Max is up to speed again, and with a 1:23.267 the 18-year-old Dutchman was topping the leaderboard. That fastest time was done about an hour before lunch. Max was able to complete 65 laps flawlessly in the RB12, almost a race distance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My first session went very well&rdquo;, Max tells Verstappen.nl. &ldquo;After Sunday&rsquo;s race, I had a good rhythm almost immediately this morning. We were able to do a lot of laps and the most important thing was that it all went without any problems. My fist impression of the new engine is positive.&rdquo;</p>

<title>Max on his first F1-win: "Very special feeling"</title>
<guid><![CDATA[http://www.verstappen.nl/?locatie=bericht&id=2506&lang=en]]></guid>
<description><![CDATA[<p>Being 18 and 227 days, Max Verstappen rewrote history today: he is the youngest Formula 1-winner ever, after claiming a spectacular victory in the Spanish Grand Prix. During his first ever podium in the pinnacle of motorsports, he got down to business, and also took hold of the biggest trophy. All of this taking place during his debut in the Red Bull Racing RB12. Superlatives just fail!</p>

<p>Max on his race: &ldquo;After the Mercedes-pair crashed, I started targeting a podium finish, but I didn&rsquo;t expect to win. During my first stint on the softs, I was able to follow closely, although my tyres were going off when I was behind of Ricciardo. Then I pitted and switched to the mediums. From that moment on, the car felt great and I was able to take care of my tyres and monitor my tempo. Looking back, we had the best strategy.&rdquo;</p>

<title>Words fail Jos after Max wins: "Unbelievable"</title>
<guid><![CDATA[http://www.verstappen.nl/?locatie=bericht&id=2505&lang=en]]></guid>
<description><![CDATA[<p>It is for Jos Verstappen also hard to grasp what his son Max brought about, after the flag dropped and he was crowned winner of the Spanish Grand Prix. &ldquo;I still cannot believe it, it is just unbelievable. Max is only 18, but the way he raced today was outright unbelievable. I don&rsquo;t know what to say&rdquo;, says Jos after a thrilling race, during which the 18-year old Red Bull Racing-driver, very skillfully, was able to fend off Kimi Raikkonen in his Ferrari.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When you see him going around the last couple of laps and you know how old the tyres are, I asked myself is he going to make it or not.&rdquo; A two-stop strategy was apparently tactical the best decision. &ldquo;In the beginning I was thinking: will it work? Everyone was thinking that I guess. In the end it did work out and I am very pleased with that.&rdquo;</p>

<title>Horner: "Very impressive victory of Max!"</title>
<guid><![CDATA[http://www.verstappen.nl/?locatie=bericht&id=2504&lang=en]]></guid>
<description><![CDATA[<p>The brilliant victory of Max Verstappen at the Spanish Grand Prix brought a party athmosphere at the Red Bull Racing team. Christian Horner, team principal of Red Bull Racing, was obviously very satisfied with the achievement of Max Verstappen.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A quite remarkable day for Max Verstappen who, on his debut for the team, has become the youngest ever race winner after producing an exemplary drive&quot;, said Horner with a lot of understatement. &quot;After the first lap incident between the Mercedes, we were in a great position to get some points, but to take on the Ferraris who had a very fast race car was always going to be difficult. We had to make some difficult decisions in the race, as it wasn&rsquo;t clear whether the two or the three stop was going to be quickest, so we elected to split the strategies. We felt that the two stop was right at the limit, but Max made the tyres last and didn&rsquo;t make any mistakes to score a very impressive victory. Daniel was obviously coming back through the field with much younger tyres, but unfortunately picked up a puncture with a couple of laps to go; otherwise I am sure he would have been on the podium too. But, there&rsquo;s a lot to look forward to and it&rsquo;s great to be back on the top step of the podium.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It feels incredible to win it, I can&#39;t believe it&rdquo;, explains Max after hearing the Dutch national anthem from the top step of the podium. &ldquo;It was an incredible race and I have to thank the team for an amazing car they&#39;ve given me. To immediately win my first race for Red Bull Racing feels awesome.&rdquo;<br />
<br />
Looking back on the race, Max said: &ldquo;It was a great one, the strategy was good and we were able to manage the tyres. To keep getting the lead and then to win the race is incredible. I still can&#39;t believe it. My dad has helped me so much in my career to achieve this, it&#39;s amazing!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am very happy to be starting from the second row&rdquo;, says Max &ndash; with microphone &ndash; in Red Bull&rsquo;s busy hospitality. &ldquo;I am pleased that I was so strong in Q1 and Q2, I didn&rsquo;t expect that. I was just trying to put a fast lap together. That lap could have been better: I have only just gotten in to this new car and every lap I do, it is getting better. I really enjoyed it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Were you not a bit disappointed that Daniel Ricciardo got the better of you in the end, while you had the upperhand in Q1 and Q2? &ldquo;No, there is no reason for that. You need to be realistic: Daniel is a very strong team mate, who knows the car longer and has all the confidence. The team is more than happy that we are third and fourth, that is just positive. We push each other and that can only be good for the team.&rdquo;</p>

<title>Horner: "Unbelieveable good qualifying from Max" </title>
<guid><![CDATA[http://www.verstappen.nl/?locatie=bericht&id=2501&lang=en]]></guid>
<description><![CDATA[<p>Red Bull Racing had a very successful qualifying for the Spanish Grand Prix. During his first outing this weekend for the British team, Max Verstappan claimed the fourth spot, not to be outdone that much by his team mate Daniel Ricciardo, finishing in third. Christian Horner, Red Bull Racing&rsquo;s team principal, was very praiseful of Max&rsquo; performance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;An amazing performance by both of our drivers today. It was a phenomenal final lap by Daniel Ricciardo, he only had one set of tyres in Q3 but he made the most of them and nailed the best lap of the weekend to line up third. Max Vertsappen, making his debut for the team this weekend, has proved to be the sensation that we know he is. He will line up alongside Daniel on the second row, in front of the Ferraris, which puts us in a great position for tomorrow&rsquo;s Grand Prix.&rdquo;</p>

<title>Max sensationally fourth in first RBR qualifying: "Podium is possible"</title>
<guid><![CDATA[http://www.verstappen.nl/?locatie=bericht&id=2500&lang=en]]></guid>
<description><![CDATA[<p>Just once in history a Dutchman was to be found so far up the grid for a Formula 1 Grand Prix. Jan Lammers was fourth with a ATS during the Grand Prix of America in Long Beach in 1980. Today, Max Verstappen equaled that record by sensationally grabbing fourth during qualifying for his Red Bull Racing team. Both Mercedes are, as expected, on the first row, with Lewis Hamilton on pole and Nico Rosberg in second. But both Red Bull Racing-drivers are ahead of the Ferrari&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The main target was to get a better feeling and to enjoy it every lap, and it worked&quot;, Max relays immediately after qualifying with a great sense of understatement. &ldquo;And with a second starting row I am of course very happy. For sure it will take a few more weekends to get used to the car, but we&rsquo;ll get there.&rdquo; What are we to think, if you still need to get used to the car but are already so close to the top? &ldquo;Well, it helps if you are enjoying it while driving the car.&rdquo; The race tomorrow, what do you expect? &quot;First I want to try and make a good start and then from there we can keep our position.&rdquo; Is a podium possible? &ldquo;In terms of pace, it looks like it, but I don&rsquo;t want to think about that, I just want to finish the race.&rdquo; Is it not disappointing to eventually be slower than Ricciardo while you were faster during most part of qualifying? &ldquo;It was not important to be faster than Daniel. I had thought that the Ferraris&rsquo; would have been better, so ending up in front of them feels very good.&rdquo;</p>

<title>Max pips team mate to fourth in final Barcelona practice</title>
<guid><![CDATA[http://www.verstappen.nl/?locatie=bericht&id=2499&lang=en]]></guid>
<description><![CDATA[<p>Max Verstappen was fourth quickest in the final free practice session of the Spanish Grand Prix. It was the first time the Dutchman was quicker than Daniel Ricciardo, who finished fifth in his Red Bull Racing. Max&#39;s fastest lap, 1:23.719, was six tenths slower than fastest man Nico Rosberg who beat team mate Lewis Hamilton and Ferrari&#39;s Sebastian Vettel to the quickest time.</p>

<p>As expected, there is not a lot of on track action at the start of FP3. Most teams are preparing for a long run and are finalizing prep for a qualifying simulation near the end of the session. With the track conditions similar to Friday, it means the team are not making any drastic set-up changes.</p>

<title>Max in P8 in Barcelona: "Happy with the first day"</title>
<guid><![CDATA[http://www.verstappen.nl/?locatie=bericht&id=2498&lang=en]]></guid>
<description><![CDATA[<p>After a solid performance, during the first free practice of the Spanish Grand Prix earlier today, Max Verstappen was able to continue his run, in the second practice, in the top ten very easily coming in at eighth. On Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya, Nico Rosberg was the fastest in his Mercedes. Kimi Raikkonen came in second, ahead of Mercedes-driver Lewis Hamilton.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am happy with how the first day went by&rdquo;, Max tells Verstappen.nl just after the session ended. &ldquo;We have managed to run through all the procedures, very important was being able to do a lot of runs with the car. I haven&rsquo;t been able to push the limits of the car yet, it&rsquo;s all a bit different than with the Toro Rosso, also the position of the seat and steering wheel are different. But it all went fine today, I am happy with how it went. It got better and better. Getting in to Q3 is of course my target for tomorrow.&rdquo;</p>

<description><![CDATA[<p>After a busy week in which Max Verstappen switched from Scuderia Toro Rosso to Red Bull Racing, Max opened his RBR account with P6 in FP1 of the Spanish Grand Prix. Sebastian Vettel lapped the Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya quickest, followed by his team mate Kimi Raikkonen and the two Mercedes in third and fourth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&#39;m very happy with the first free practice sessions&rdquo;, explained Max to Verstappen.nl. &ldquo;We took our time to work through our programme and we got everything that was planned done. We&#39;ve gone through all procedures well and had a good practice start&rdquo;, said the Dutchman who felt at ease in his new car. &ldquo;The first feeling was good and positive. I feel at home in this car.&rdquo;</p>

<title>Max at FIA press conference: "Very happy with chance Red Bull gave me"</title>
<guid><![CDATA[http://www.verstappen.nl/?locatie=bericht&id=2496&lang=en]]></guid>
<description><![CDATA[<p>The Thursday FIA drivers&rsquo; press conference, looked a lot like a Red Bull team meeting with Red Bull Racing&rsquo;s Max Verstappen, local hero Carlos Sainz and his Scuderia Toro Rosso team mate Daniil Kvyat all on the front row.</p>

<p>With Max&rsquo;s recent switch from Toro Rosso to Red Bull Racing, the Dutchman was asked if the promotion posed a risk. &ldquo;To be honest, I&rsquo;m very happy with the opportunity that Red Bull gave me. Racing for a top team was always what I wanted. I think my debut in Formula 1 last year was probably a bigger risk but that went well.&rdquo;</p>

<title>Max Verstappen: "I think I didn't sleep for three days!"</title>
<guid><![CDATA[http://www.verstappen.nl/?locatie=bericht&id=2494&lang=en]]></guid>
<description><![CDATA[<p>After the announcement that Max Verstappen would be taking Daniil Kvyat&rsquo;s seat at Red Bull Racing, the young Dutchman has had a pretty busy schedule. Some of the things on his agenda included him visiting the factory of his new team in Milton Keynes and driving the Catcher Car for the Wings for Life World Run in Breda. Tonight he spoke at Ziggo Sport&rsquo;s Peptalk, by means of a satellite link. He disclosed that he was elated as well when he got word that he had been promoted from Scuderia Toro Rosso to Red Bull Racing: &ldquo;I think I didn&rsquo;t sleep for three nights!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was very motivated to go straight to the team&rdquo;, Max tells, &ldquo;because you know that it is a top team and you also know that you have more chances to get closer to the podium. When I finally got to the factory, I couldn&rsquo;t stop. I have done a lot of work in the simulator and have been very busy with the team also.&rdquo;</p>

<title>Max excited for debut Red Bull Racing: "Can't wait to jump in the car"</title>
<guid><![CDATA[http://www.verstappen.nl/?locatie=bericht&id=2493&lang=en]]></guid>
<description><![CDATA[<p>After joining Red Bull Racing last week, Max Verstappen is eager to drive the RB12 for the first time, next Friday in Barcelona.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m very excited for the opportunity to drive for Red Bull Racing and I can&rsquo;t wait to jump in the car in Barcelona. I have a lot of work to do ahead of the race, lots of data to study but luckily it&rsquo;s a track I know well because we have driven there so much.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Max says about Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya: &ldquo;The main straight is quite a long one, so you need a good top speed. For me the best parts of the track are turn 3 and turn 9, as they are both high-speed ones. The last sector is also interesting, as it&rsquo;s very technical and hard on tyres.&quot;</p>

<title>Max overtakes 3641 runners during Wings for Life World Run</title>
<guid><![CDATA[http://www.verstappen.nl/?locatie=bericht&id=2492&lang=en]]></guid>
<description><![CDATA[<p>Max Verstappen operated as a &#39;rolling finish&#39; line in Sunday&#39;s Wings for Life World Run. During the Dutch leg of the world wide event, Max drove the Catcher Car. Every runner overtaken by the Dutchman in the car is out of the race. The last man standing wins the event.&nbsp;The idea behind the event, hosted simultaneously in 33 countries, is to run for those who can&#39;t. All the money raised will go to the spinal chord research foundation.&nbsp;</p>

<p>During the event, the Dutchman had time to answer some questions, the first one being what he thought of driving around so slowly during the Wings for Life World Run. &ldquo;I have to maintain a certain speed, starting at 15km/h. But it&#39;s a lot of fun and I can encourage the runners. It&#39;s great to see the enthusiasm of the runner so it really doesn&rsquo;t matter to me how fast I&#39;m going. I&#39;m just happy to be part of such a wonderful cause.&rdquo;</p>

<title>Jos: "What Max has shown on track, has had major influence"</title>
<guid><![CDATA[http://www.verstappen.nl/?locatie=bericht&id=2491&lang=en]]></guid>
<description><![CDATA[<p>Jos Verstappen has been a driving force behind the career of Max from a tender age onwards. The proud father has stood by his now 18-year old son, to the best of his knowledge and capabilities in order to learn him the tricks of the trade.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am extremely happy with the chance Max has gotten to show his prowess at a top team. That has always been our objective. The things Max has shown on track, have had a major influence on that&rdquo;, says Jos. &ldquo;Even though the transition has come earlier than expected, you certainly grab the opportunity. There was never a doubt in our minds: Max is ready, he has shown that. His mistakes are few, he grows rapidly and does strong races in which he scores massively. We are very happy that Red Bull has put their faith in Max by transitioning him already to the sister team.&rdquo;</p>

<title>Interview: Max checks in at factory Red Bull Racing</title>
<guid><![CDATA[http://www.verstappen.nl/?locatie=bericht&id=2489&lang=en]]></guid>
<description><![CDATA[<p>Following the announcement that Max Verstappen will join Daniel Ricciardo in the RB12 for the Spanish Grand Prix at Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya next week, the Dutchman arrived at the Red Bull Racing factory in Milton Keynes to meet the team and get preparations underway.</p>

<p>Before he got started on what is sure to be a busy week for him and the team, we caught up with Max to get the inside line on his feelings of becoming a driver for Red Bull Racing.&nbsp;</p>

<p>On hearing the news...<br />
Max: &ldquo;Well, of course I was very happy. A bit shocked as well - I didn&#39;t expect it, but yes I&#39;m very happy with the opportunity of course. I have to say a big thank you to Red Bull and Dr Helmut Marko and now I just can&#39;t wait to jump into the car.&rdquo;</p>

<p>On the likely difference between the STR11 and RB12...<br />
Max: &ldquo;Well hopefully it will be faster, that&#39;s the main target. I just hope to feel comfortable in the car because that&#39;s what a driver needs. We&#39;ll find out in Barcelona. I have never driven the RB12 before, it will be a new experience and there are a lot of procedures to learn, but I&#39;m up for it.</p>

<description><![CDATA[<p>Red Bull Racing will have a new driver line-up from the Spanish Grand Prix. Max Verstappen will be joining the team to drive alongside Daniel Ricciardo. Daniil Kvyat will continue to drive for Red Bull and will re-join sister team Scuderia Toro Rosso.</p>

<p>Christian Horner, team principal says: &quot;Max has proven to be an outstanding young talent. His performance at Toro Rosso has been impressive so far and we are pleased to give him the opportunity to drive for Red Bull Racing.&quot;&nbsp;</p>

<p>&quot;We are in the unique position to have all four drivers across Red Bull Racing and Toro Rosso under long term contracts with Red Bull, so we have the flexibility to move them between the two teams.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Dany will be able to continue his development at Toro Rosso, in a team that he is familiar with, giving him the chance to regain his form and show his potential.&quot;</p>

<description><![CDATA[<p>Technical director of Scuderia Toro Rosso, James Key, reflects on the Russian GP: &ldquo;The race pace was there with both drivers and we had worked a lot with them on tyre management so they knew what they had to do. Max obviously had to start on his used supersofts from Q3 and we had to be a bit careful as we were not sure what to expect. Therefore, we had looked at both a one or a two stop strategy, in case he got bad degradation.&rdquo;</p>

<title>Franz Tost praises Verstappen</title>
<guid><![CDATA[http://www.verstappen.nl/?locatie=bericht&id=2485&lang=en]]></guid>
<description><![CDATA[<p>Franz Tost, team principal of Scuderia Toro Rosso, praised Max Verstappen after the Russian Grand Prix for the Dutchman&#39;s performance in Sochi. &quot;Quite a dramatic race&quot;, the Austrian analysed after the race. &quot;Max was racing in sixth place after the start and was able to keep this position quite easily, creating a big gap to Alonso who was behind in seventh place. With 20 laps to go, we had a problem with the power unit and therefore Max had to stop. It&#39;s a shame, because we really had the pace to finish easily in sixth position, as he was doing a fantastic job. We will now fully concentrate on our preparation for Barcelona, where we had a very competitive package during winter testing, and hopefully we will be luckier there.&quot;</p>

<title>Verstappen's first DNF in Sochi: "We could have scored many points"</title>
<guid><![CDATA[http://www.verstappen.nl/?locatie=bericht&id=2484&lang=en]]></guid>
<description><![CDATA[<p>Max Verstappen failed to finish for the first time this season, it happened during the Russian Grand Prix. After a difficult Friday and a much better Saturday, the youngster impressed friend and foe by being briefly second in the Sochi-race. While being certain to score points in sixth place, Verstappen was unfortunately forced to retire his Toro Rosso with technical issues from the race. Nico Rosberg, once again, claimed victory with ease; his fourth in a row. Lewis Hamilton, starting from tenth, finished second as Kimi Raikkonen completed the podium in third for Ferrari.</p>

<p>After the race, Verstappen recounts with mixed feelings: &ldquo;It is a disappointing result. Not only for me but also for the team, because we could have scored many points here today. The race was good before until we ran into engine issues. I was following the drivers in front of me. We could have been fifth or sixth because from the rear there was no pressure. I was in complete control of my position on track. In that respect it was a lonely race. Later on, we saw drivers having issues with their tyres, so who knows, there might have been more in store for us. My tyres were fine. And then the engine died.&rdquo; The problem manifested itself long before it actually happened, says Max: &ldquo;Exiting turn 13, I felt that something was not right and moments later I needed to retire the car. Before that, there was no problem at all. But, that is racing: it is a mechanical sport, so these things happen.&rdquo;</p>

<title>James Key: "We recovered reasonably well"</title>
<guid><![CDATA[http://www.verstappen.nl/?locatie=bericht&id=2483&lang=en]]></guid>
<description><![CDATA[<p>James Key, Technical Director of Scuderia Toro Rosso, says after qualifying on Saturday in Russia: &ldquo;I think this morning we recovered reasonably well with car balance on both cars compared to yesterday, particularly on Max&rsquo;s, where we were able to build in some stability with changes overnight. As a result, this morning&rsquo;s practice was a lot more competitive. We knew that today&rsquo;s qualifying was going to be very tight, with a big bunch of teams very close together behind Mercedes, Ferrari and Williams. We were confident that reaching Q3 was possible with both cars, but we knew it had to be a very well-executed quali to make sure it worked. Sadly for Carlos, he didn&rsquo;t quite get through as Kvyat just got ahead at the end of Q2, which pushed him down to P11. So unfortunately he starts in eleventh position, but at least has the advantage of new tyres.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Max did a good job to get through to Q3, even though we underperformed in the final part of the session and we now need to understand what happened. I think tomorrow is going to be very interesting. This is a tricky track. Tyres are performing to a certain extent as expected, but it&rsquo;s going to be tight on strategy and tyre management. We know you can overtake here, even though it&rsquo;s difficult, so it&rsquo;s going to be interesting to see exactly how the race works out. Our race pace will be better than our quali pace, which is typically the case, so now we need to look at the positions we are in and how we can progress: that&rsquo;s our plan for tonight.&rdquo;</p>

<title>Max in the top ten in Sochi: "Very happy with P9"</title>
<guid><![CDATA[http://www.verstappen.nl/?locatie=bericht&id=2482&lang=en]]></guid>
<description><![CDATA[<p>After Max Verstappen finished in P7 in the third free practice, which took place earlier this Saturday, and by doing so claimed a spot in the top ten, he once again did the same during qualifying alongside the select few drivers who were to do battle for the best starting position in the Russian Grand Prix. The youngster finished in Q3 eventually in the ninth spot. Nico Rosberg, in his Mercedes, was the fastest man on track, followed by Sebastian Vettel in the Ferrari. Valtteri Bottas, in his Williams, finished the top three.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am very happy we finished in ninth&rdquo;, Max informs Verstappen.nl straight after qualifying finished. &ldquo;Especially after a difficult day we had yesterday, I didn&rsquo;t expect to make it to Q3. The hard work paid out. The balance of the car was much better today. Q1 went reasonably well, but the first lap in Q2 was very good. That enabled us to make it through to Q3. For the last run in Q3 we made some adjustments to the front wing, but that didn&rsquo;t work out well. We will see how things will go tomorrow.&rdquo;</p>

<title>Max P7 in Sochi: "Balance much better"</title>
<guid><![CDATA[http://www.verstappen.nl/?locatie=bericht&id=2481&lang=en]]></guid>
<description><![CDATA[<p>Max Verstappen has managed to finish quite handsomely in P7, after the rather difficult free practices on Friday. During the third, and final free practice, prior to the qualifying for the Russian Grand Prix, he had a 1,7 seconds deficit to the front of the field. On the 5,848 meters long semi-street circuit in Sochi, Lewis Hamilton clocked the fastest time in his Mercedes, followed by his team mate Nico Rosberg, as Sebastian Vettel took third in his Ferrari.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The balance of the car was much better today. At first it was a bit of getting used to because the car didn&rsquo;t feel like I am normally used to. We were able to do some fine tuning and eventually do some good times I am happy with. The changes on the car, worked out well&rdquo;, Max tells Verstappen.nl immediately after the end of the final free practice. &ldquo;For qualifying, everyone is so close that it will be very important to be able to squeeze out a good lap.&rdquo;</p>

<title>Phil Charles: "Day with mixed feelings"</title>
<guid><![CDATA[http://www.verstappen.nl/?locatie=bericht&id=2480&lang=en]]></guid>
<description><![CDATA[<p>Phil Charles, chief race engineer at Scuderia Toro Rosso, says after Friday in Sochi:&nbsp;&ldquo;It was a bit of a mixed bag for us today. The track was quite low grip and we found the last sector in particular quite hard to master for a lot of the running. Overall Carlos was a bit happier: he hit on a balance he was quite happy with in the long-run on soft tyres. For Max it was a bit of a different story; we clearly have a bit of work to do tonight because we didn&rsquo;t really hit a sweet spot with him today, so we will put the hard work in tonight to get him happy and back to where he normally is&rdquo;, concludes Charles.</p>

<title>P12 for Max in Sochi FP2: "A tough day"</title>
<guid><![CDATA[http://www.verstappen.nl/?locatie=bericht&id=2479&lang=en]]></guid>
<description><![CDATA[<p>Max Verstappen continued his Russian GP weekend with a twelfth place in free practice two. The Dutchman lapped the Sochi Autodrome in a 1:39.501. After Nico Rosberg topped the timing tables after FP1, Lewis Hamilton continued the Mercedes supremacy by setting the quickest time of the session, followed by Sebastian Vettel, Rosberg and Kimi Raikkonen.</p>

<p>&quot;It was a tough day with a lot of oversteer&quot;, said Max to Verstappen.nl. &quot;We haven&#39;t found a solution yet. It&#39;s tricky because I don&#39;t know how fast I can go into corners and if you try to go faster you easily end up off track. There&#39;s still a lot of work to do so it&#39;s going to be a long night.&quot;</p>

<title>Max fifteenth in FP1: "Still work to do"</title>
<guid><![CDATA[http://www.verstappen.nl/?locatie=bericht&id=2478&lang=en]]></guid>
<description><![CDATA[<p>Max Verstappen opened his Russian Grand Prix weekend with P15 in the first free practice session. Nico Rosberg clocked the quickest time on the Sochi track with team mate Lewis Hamilton and Ferrari ace Sebastian Vettel completing the top three.</p>

<p>“There’s still work to do”, says Max to Verstappen.nl. “The car doesn’t have a lot of grip on the slippery and dusty track. The circuit is always ‘green’ during the first session which also affects the grip. We’ll now analyse the data to improve the set-up for the second free practice.”</p>

<title>Column: Jos Verstappen - Criticising Hamilton is too easy</title>
<guid><![CDATA[http://www.verstappen.nl/?locatie=bericht&id=2477&lang=en]]></guid>
<description><![CDATA[<p>Jos Verstappen is still the Netherlands most successful Formula 1-driver. This season also, he shares his opinions regarding the sport via a column in the Dutch daily newspaper <em>De Telegraaf. </em>Below the latest edition.</p>

<p>"The Sochi circuit in the Olympic Park still has an atmosphere of the previous winter Olympics. When I joined Max on his track walk on Wednesday, I noticed how tidy and colourful – the numerous flags really add to that – the place looks. In that respect I'm impressed with what the Russians achieved here. It cost a lot and it looks like the facilities aren’t used that often, but the place does have allure that suits Formula 1.</p>

<title>Max: "Qualifying P5 in Sochi is not realistic"</title>
<guid><![CDATA[http://www.verstappen.nl/?locatie=bericht&id=2476&lang=en]]></guid>
<description><![CDATA[<p>Max Verstappen is hoping for a positive weekend in Russia as he described the qualities you need to tackle the Sochi track. "You're aiming to have a clean lap with not too much oversteer," said the Dutchman. "You need to hit the apexes, as the majority of corners are 90 degrees and all pretty similar. You also need good top speed and, even if we know we are not the fastest down the straights, we will be trying our best to make up time in the corners, but with 90 degree turns that is a difficult task.” </p>

<p>Max continues: “Getting the tyres working properly will be a challenge: it was already difficult last year but this time we can expect cooler temperatures, making it even harder. On paper, you'd be aiming to get away with a one-stop strategy, but that's not so straightforward with the new 70% tread factor introduced this season. So, on the tyre side, we will have to wait and see after the second and third free practice sessions."</p>

<description><![CDATA[<p>Looking ahead to the Russian Grand Prix, Max says: “The first thing I remember from Russia is my good qualifying! It's always good to start the race from the highest spot possible and starting P9 in Russia meant already being in the point's positions… Even though we unfortunately didn't have a good start in the race: I arrived to turn 1 and Hulkenberg spun in front of me, we collided in turn 2 and I had a puncture. It wasn't great, as I had damage on the car and it all got very tricky but I still tried to do my best.” In the end Max finished tenth.</p>

<title>Tost after Chinese GP: "Satisfying result"</title>
<guid><![CDATA[http://www.verstappen.nl/?locatie=bericht&id=2471&lang=en]]></guid>
<description><![CDATA[<p>Franz Tost, team principal of Scuderia Toro Rosso, says after the Chinese race: “The Chinese Grand Prix was a very exciting race from start to finish. Both Max and Carlos did a really good start, but unfortunately Max lost some places in the first corner as he had to back off because of the crash between the two Ferraris. Carlos was in a good position until the safety car came out when he was then heavily stopped by Hulkenberg, who slowed down massively in the pit-lane and this caused us to lose a lot of places. Nevertheless, both drivers were able to catch-up and crossed the line in P8 and P9 – a very satisfying result. Both cars scored points, we showed that the car is competitive and that the team and drivers did a good job. I’d like to thank everyone for this and we are now looking forward to the race in Sochi where we also expect quite a good performance from our side.” </p>

<title>Max 8th in a catch-up race in China: "Very pleased"</title>
<guid><![CDATA[http://www.verstappen.nl/?locatie=bericht&id=2470&lang=en]]></guid>
<description><![CDATA[<p>Max Verstappen finished in eighth during the Chinese Grand Prix in a race that had a troubled opening. The start of the race was very tumultuous, as the safety car jostled the entire field. Nico Rosberg drove unthreatened to victory in front of Sebastian Vettel’s Ferrari and both Red Bulls, in which Daniil Kvyat claimed P3 ahead of Daniel Ricciardo in fourth.</p>

<p>“When the lights turned green, I reacted fast enough, but the car was in the wrong power mode, causing me to not have full power. That was my mistake”, Max explains to Verstappen.nl about his start. “I lost some positions because of that and also during the first pit stop, when both Sainz and I came in together, I lost more. Which put me at the back of a string of cars. That’s when I thought ‘this is not working as planned’. But I remained calm, didn’t get frustrated, fought my way back and overtook them one by one.”</p>

<title>James Key: "A very eventful day"</title>
<guid><![CDATA[http://www.verstappen.nl/?locatie=bericht&id=2469&lang=en]]></guid>
<description><![CDATA[<p>James Key, Technical Director of Scuderia Toro Rosso, says after qualifying on Saturday in China: “A very eventful day. Today’s qualifying was an exciting session, with a lot going on. I think we come away happy to have both cars through to top ten relatively easily but a little bit frustrated that we didn’t really pull it together with the final runs in Q3. Both cars lost quite a bit of time in the third sector during their final run, which means that we are 8th and 9th when I think we could’ve been a little bit higher than that.”</p>

<p>“We clearly need to look into this and understand what happened, but it’s history now and our immediate priority is to move on and concentrate on preparation for the race. There are several strategies that need to be considered given the combination of tyres available so there may be some different approaches tomorrow. It’s also a bit difficult to predict because conditions look like they will be pretty warm so we will need to consider how this may affect the tyres and what implications there are for our plans.”</p>

Pole position was once again for Mercedes with Nico Rosberg claiming top spot. Daniel Ricciardo surprised with P2 ahead of Kimi Raikkonen and Sebastian Vettel.</p>

<p>“I'm not unhappy. Of course you always hope for a better result, but we were in the top ten again, which is always important”, said Max to Verstappen.nl. “I definitely see possibilities to get a better result in the race. A lot will depend on strategy so I'm looking forward to an interesting race.”</p>

<title>Max P9 in China: "Curious about the qualifying"</title>

<description><![CDATA[<p>During a wet third free practice, in the run up to the Chinese Grand Prix, Max Verstappen noted the ninth fastest time. On the 5,451 meters long Shanghai International Circuit, it was Sebastian Vettel in his Ferrari who was the fastest in front of Valtteri Bottas. Sergio Perez claimed the third spot in his Force India.</p>

<p>“It is a pity that we were not able to do that many laps because of the rain”, Max informed Verstappen.nl. “As oppose to many others, I drove with a race set up. It’s in the qualifying that it it will matter, shortly. I am curious.”</p>

<title>Phil Charles: "Very satisfied after Friday" </title>
<guid><![CDATA[http://www.verstappen.nl/?locatie=bericht&id=2466&lang=en]]></guid>
<description><![CDATA[<p>Phil Charles, chief race engineer at Scuderia Toro Rosso, says after Friday in Shanghai: “China is usually a real challenge. Firstly, the tyres have a very hard time and, as engineers, we are on tender hooks to see if the front-left grains badly or not. On top of this, it is very technically tricky for the drivers too and they can have a massive impact on how the tyres behave." </p>

<p>"Today lived up to those China sentiments. We saw some interesting patterns of behaviour across the three tyre compounds, especially in the long runs. We will be going through the data carefully tonight with the drivers to best understand how to make them work for Sunday. On our side we are pretty happy having worked through most of our program checklist and both drivers having settled in well. We will also be watching the weather forecast for tomorrow very keenly tonight as there may be some rain to give us some more entertainment!”</p>

<title>Max sixth in FP2: "Reasonably happy"</title>
<guid><![CDATA[http://www.verstappen.nl/?locatie=bericht&id=2465&lang=en]]></guid>
<description><![CDATA[<p>Max Verstappen finished sixth in the second free practice session of the Chinese Grand Prix. The Dutchman trailed the front running Ferraris of Sebastian Vettel and Kimi Raikkonen by 1.3 seconds. Both Mercedes, for once not topping the leader boards, followed the Ferraris in third and fourth.</p>

<p>“It went ok. The balance of the car was better than in FP1 so that’s positive”, said Max to Verstappen.nl. “The difference between the medium and the super-soft Pirellis is pretty big. To be able to instantly do a quick lap on the super-softs is challenging but it looked good.”<br />
<br />
With rain forecast for qualifying, Max heads into an interesting Saturday: “I’m curious how we’ll do in a wet qualifying. It’s all very close but our long runs are pretty good so I’m reasonably happy.”</p>

<title>Column: Jos Verstappen - Max wants to score 100 points</title>
<guid><![CDATA[http://www.verstappen.nl/?locatie=bericht&id=2463&lang=en]]></guid>
<description><![CDATA[<p>Jos Verstappen is still the Netherlands most successful Formula 1-driver. This season he shares his opinions regarding the sport via a column in Dutch daily newspaper <em>De Telegraaf. </em>Below the latest edition.</p>

<p>“Max’ sixth place in Bahrain was better than we had all expected. Toro Rosso always had difficult races there in the past. Although we were less strong during qualifying, the final result was just super. The team particularly praised the way Max took care of his tyres. But when I talked to him about that afterwards, he said: ‘Dad, I always take care of the tyres, but that also depends on how the car responds and our strategy.’ Everything fell nicely into its place. That was somehow needed by the way, given the disappointment of the first Grand Prix.</p>

<title>Max tenth in chaotic China FP1</title>
<guid><![CDATA[http://www.verstappen.nl/?locatie=bericht&id=2464&lang=en]]></guid>
<description><![CDATA[<p>Max Verstappen started his Chinese Grand Prix weekend with P10 in the first free practice session. Nico Rosberg topped the timing sheets, two seconds faster than the Dutchman in his Scuderia Toro Rosso. Lewis Hamilton and Sebastian Vettel completed the top three. Despite the usual suspects at the business of the leader boards, it was a chaotic FP1, which was twice interrupted at length by red flag situations caused by punctures.<br />
<br />
“It's a shame we weren’t able to do many laps due to the two red flags. The track was also dirty with a lot of sand”, explains Max to Verstappen.nl. “In the last six minutes I was able to do some laps on the softer tyres but due to a small technical issue I lost some time. I think it will all be fine. The car isn’t optimal yet, but we'll work on that so I'm looking forward to FP2.”</p>

<title>Max looks ahead to Chinese GP: "Top five would be great"</title>
<guid><![CDATA[http://www.verstappen.nl/?locatie=bericht&id=2462&lang=en]]></guid>
<description><![CDATA[<p>Looking back at the previous Grand Prix, Max Verstappen said on Thursday in Shanghai: “Bahrain was definitely very positive for me and for the team and the result was slightly unexpected. It was good to score mine and Toro Rosso's first points at that track. Apart from that, I was also pleased that I had a very clean race with no mistakes.”</p>

<p>After just two races, Max is optimistic about how his car will develop over the coming season. “There is definitely more to come from the car and, at this point of the year we are still working to understand more about it, which is the same for all teams and the same as happens every year”, explained Max. “But the general feeling I have is that the car reacts well to inputs and we have quite a competitive package. In Bahrain we had it set up just right, so now we must concentrate on doing that at every Grand Prix.”</p>

<title>Max: "Had some good overtakes in China"</title>
<guid><![CDATA[http://www.verstappen.nl/?locatie=bericht&id=2459&lang=en]]></guid>
<description><![CDATA[<p>“I like China, I remember I had some good overtakes there! The first four corners of the circuit, turns 1 to 4, are a very special part and tricky to get right. Another part of the track that I enjoyed last year was turn 6… I did a good move there! I couldn't overtake Perez on the straight, so I had to do it somewhere else… I got a good exit out of turn 5 and, approaching turn 6, where you normally brake late – as it's a hairpin – I managed to overtake him by braking even later than usual. It's a big relief when you finally get passed a rival and I was very happy.”</p>

<title>Max drives a solid race in Bahrain: "Great to finish in 6th"</title>
<guid><![CDATA[http://www.verstappen.nl/?locatie=bericht&id=2457&lang=en]]></guid>
<description><![CDATA[<p>Max Verstappen finished in sixth during the Bahrain Grand Prix in a thrilling race. Even though he barely managed to clinch a top ten position, after having good free practices on Friday and qualifying on Saturday. But with this feat the youngster gets even for the false start of the season’s opener in Australia, two weeks ago. The eight points earned, are the first Scuderia Toro Rosso has even scored in Sakhir. On the Bahrain International Circuit, Nico Rosberg won the race in his Mercedes, ahead of the Ferrari driving Kimi Raikkonen. Reigning world champion, Lewis Hamilton, came in third in his Mercedes.</p>

<p>Immediately after the race, a cheerful Max talks to Verstappen.nl: “It was a great race. It is fantastic to finish in sixth here, all the more that this isn’t a circuit that suits us well. It went much better, than we anticipated before the weekend. The choices we made yesterday, paid off during the race. This is a track where you can overtake very well and I had some great moves. Unfortunately we couldn’t catch Grosjean anymore at the end. The tyres were working well, the car was handling fine, the pit stops and strategy were super. The whole team did a great job and I had a lot of fun today!”</p>

<title>Franz Tost: "P6 a good result"</title>
<guid><![CDATA[http://www.verstappen.nl/?locatie=bericht&id=2456&lang=en]]></guid>
<description><![CDATA[<p>Franz Tost, Team Principal of Scuderia Toro Rosso, says after the race in Bahrain: “Taking into consideration that we started today’s race from P10 and P11, to finish with a car in P6 is, on one side, a really good result but, on the other, it’s a pity we had to retire the other car. I’d like to congratulate Max and the team, because both parties did a really good and professional job, both regarding strategy and pit-stops.”</p>

<p>“Unfortunately, Carlos had a collision with Perez, which caused a puncture on the right-rear tyre at the beginning of his lap. As a result of this, while driving back to the pits, the floor also got damaged… We therefore ended up deciding to call him in, even though originally we made him stay out just in case there was a Safety Car period. This never happened so we ended his race prematurely as the car was very unstable in the rear because of the amount of downforce we had lost. On a more positive note, this is the first time we score points here in Bahrain, so we can be happy with this, and we now look forward to China, where we expect to be quite competitive.”</p>

<title>Key: "We have a little bit of an advantage"</title>
<guid><![CDATA[http://www.verstappen.nl/?locatie=bericht&id=2455&lang=en]]></guid>
<description><![CDATA[<p>James Key, technical director at Scuderia Toro Rosso, commented after qualifying in Bahrein: "We knew that out of the first four events this year, Bahrain was always going to be the trickiest one for us and unfortunately this proved to be the case today. This is a stop-start track, where longitudinal performance is a bigger player than lateral performance, and we are weaker in longitudinal than lateral... So it's not playing to the strengths of our car as much as other circuits will be. The nature of this track is also to pull the field a lot closer and so it was very tight between teams today."</p>

<title>Verstappen qualifies in tenth: "A good result"</title>
<guid><![CDATA[http://www.verstappen.nl/?locatie=bericht&id=2454&lang=en]]></guid>
<description><![CDATA[<p>Max Verstappen will start the Bahrain Grand Prix from tenth on the grid, one place ahead of team mate Carlos Sainz. Both Toro Rossos will therefore have the option to choose the tyre compound ahead of the race. Pole position was once again for Mercedes with Lewis Hamilton beating Nico Rosberg to lock out the front row ahead of the two Ferraris.</p>

<p>“Of course you always want to be further up the grid but on this track it's a good result”, said Max to Verstappen.nl. “It's not a track that suits our car that much so to be this close to Q3 is good. I also didn’t have enough tyres to go out for another lap. I would've liked to, but in the end we can be very happy with tenth. In Q2 it's always difficult to judge where you're going to end up. You would rather be ninth then eighth so we're pretty happy with today."</p>

<title>Verstappen P15 in FP3: "Really useful long run"</title>
<guid><![CDATA[http://www.verstappen.nl/?locatie=bericht&id=2453&lang=en]]></guid>
<description><![CDATA[<p>In the final free practice session ahead of qualifying for the Bahrain Grand Prix, Max Verstappen finished in P15. The two Scuderia Toro Rosso drivers, both hindered by small technical issues, were among the few drivers that opted out of using the super soft tyres for their quickest laps. At the front, the Ferrari duo of Sebastian Vettel and Kimi Raikkonen led the way, four tenths ahead of both Mercedes.</p>

<p>“It might not look fast, but that's because we did a long run on a high fuel load”, explains Max to Verstappen.nl “We had a different programme than most teams. I also had a problem which meant I had to come into the pits. The team fixed it, although I'm not sure what the issue was. It meant I was able to finish my long run, which was really useful.”</p>

<p>In the second half of the session the Dutchman set quicker times. “At the end we went out on the softs, not the super softs like the rest of the teams. That's why that time wasn't really representative. But it's going to be very close in qualifying. Anything can happen between P5 and P14.”</p>

In free practice 2 we had Carlos long-running the medium and Max the soft tyre. As engineers we now have quite a busy night with plenty of homework to do!"</p>

<title>Max fourth in Bahrain's second free practice: "It looks positive"</title>
<guid><![CDATA[http://www.verstappen.nl/?locatie=bericht&id=2451&lang=en]]></guid>
<description><![CDATA[<p>Max Verstappen started the Friday in Bahrain excellently. After finishing in eighth during the first free practice, the 18-year old Formula 1-driver positioned himself quite neatly in fourth in the second practice. Nico Rosberg and Lewis Hamilton were, once again, flawless and were a second up on Jenson Button (McLaren) in their Mercedes. Max was able to stay ahead of Kimi Raikkonen (P5) and Sebastian Vettel (P6) in their Ferrari’s.</p>

<p>“This is a good start of the weekend”, as Max starts talking to Verstappen.nl. “The track conditions were different now and of course we need to improve many things, but it is definitely a good start. We were able to run and work on the set-up of the car, so that is very positive.” Does the Bahrain track suit the STR11 as well? “It’s going well now, but we are trying to stay grounded because we do not know what others have tested. We will need to keep improving, just like the others. But for now, it definitely looks positive.”</p>

<description><![CDATA[<p>Max Verstappen clocked the eighth fastest time in the first free practice session of the Bahrain Grand Prix. The Scuderia Toro Rosso driver trailed fastest man Nico Rosberg by 2.5 seconds. The German finished the session on top ahead of Mercedes team mate Lewis Hamilton and Ferrari’s Kimi Raikkonen.</p>

<p>“It went pretty well. We took our time to pick up the pace and familiarize ourselves”, said Max to Verstappen.nl. “The conditions weren’t optimal because of the sand and dust on the track. Nevertheless we worked on improving our set-up. It isn’t yet how we want it to be so we’ll have some work to do. But it was good to have driven here again.”</p>

<title>Column: Jos Verstappen - Criticism should be kept indoors</title>
<guid><![CDATA[http://www.verstappen.nl/?locatie=bericht&id=2449&lang=en]]></guid>
<description><![CDATA[<p>Jos Verstappen is still the Netherlands most successful Formula 1-driver. This season also, he shares his opinions regarding the sport via a column in the Dutch daily newspaper <em>De Telegraaf. </em>Below the latest edition.</p>

<p>“The Bahrain Grand Prix is just around the corner, but the aftermath of the first race of this season in Australia is still noticeable. It is obvious that both Max as his team, had higher expectations of the race in Melbourne.<br />
<br />
Max was on the receiving end of a lot of criticism because of his falling out with his team on the radio during the race. His remarks were a result of his frustration and anger on how the race was progressing and decisions made by the team, but I am, in no way, condoning the way he reacted. It was the first time Max did something like that and I spoke extensively with him about it. He knows very well that something like that is not appropriate and not done. It is also not professional for a Formula 1-driver. Criticism, you keep to yourself and after the race, you talk about it. Indoors, with the team. And not through the media.</p>

<title>Max happy with new starting procedure: "I can handle it well."</title>
<guid><![CDATA[http://www.verstappen.nl/?locatie=bericht&id=2448&lang=en]]></guid>
<description><![CDATA[<p>During the FIA press conference prior to the Bahrain Grand Prix, Fernando Alonso received the most question. The Spaniard will sit out the second round of the championship after the FIA deemed him not fit enough to race after his horror crash in the season opener in Melbourne. His replacement will be the Stoffel Vandoorne, the reigning GP2 champion. The Belgian will make his F1 debut this weekend.</p>

<p>Max Verstappen was also present at the press conference. After a tumultuous race in Australia, the press want to know what Max had learned from Melbourne. “First of all we had a great qualifying, so we can be happy with that. But of course the race didn’t work out like we wanted to. We analysed everything and hopefully we can get back stronger here in Bahrain. Even though this track hasn’t suited Toro Rosso in the past, we’ll give it our best, that’s for sure.”  </p>

<guid><![CDATA[http://www.verstappen.nl/?locatie=bericht&id=2446&lang=en]]></guid>
<description><![CDATA[<p>Max Verstappen previews the Bahrain GP: “The Bahrain circuit has a very long straight – too long last year! – and they overtook me quite a few times there in 2015… It's not a nice feeling and inside your head you're talking to yourself and saying ‘c'mon, c'mon!’. It's frustrating, but there's not much more you can do when another car is quicker than you.”</p>

<p>“I also remember a lot of national flags on the left after the first three turns. I first saw them during the track walk, but then I sometimes also had time to see them while driving. Turns 5, 6 and 7 were a bit tough to get right when it was dark as the braking points change, but it's still a nice part of the track as I always enjoy the fast corners.”</p>

<description><![CDATA[<p>Looking back at the first Grand Prix in Melbourne, Max Verstappen is asked how his first race weekend of 2016 went. “I think generally the week started off well. We improved the car every time step‑by‑step, even though the conditions were not great with the rain and in order to save tyres. The qualifying was absolutely perfect.  To be fifth behind Mercedes and the Ferrari cars, that's definitely where we wanted to be. That was all great. I think we could be very happy with that.”</p>

<p>Max continues on Laureus.com, after the interview of today: “Then in the race, I think the start was good. First stint was also good. Then we had some miscommunications, I would say, and not a great finish.” Did the incident with team mate Carlos Sainz lead to rivalry? “To be honest, it doesn't really feel like such a thing. First of all, I'm always focusing ahead. So for me, to be honest, it doesn't really affect me as a struggle. We want to beat each other on track, but I think every driver wants to beat his team mate. And off‑track, everything is going well, so there are no issues there.”</p>

<title>Max opts for different tyre allocation than Carlos</title>
<guid><![CDATA[http://www.verstappen.nl/?locatie=bericht&id=2442&lang=en]]></guid>
<description><![CDATA[<p>Pirelli, Formula 1’s sole tyre supplier, has announced the teams’ tyre choices ahead of the Bahrain Grand Prix. From this season onwards, the Italian manufacturer supplies three different compound per weekend, instead of two. The drivers must use at least two of them during the race. Like the Australian Grand Prix, Pirelli will supply the medium, soft and super soft slicks. Each driver can choose up to thirteen sets of tyres per weekend. Their choice has to be made well in advance, three months prior to the Grand Prix.</p>

<p>Scuderia Toro Rosso’s drivers, Max Verstappen and Carlos Sainz have chosen different strategies with the Dutchman opting for one set of the mediums, seven softs and five super softs. His Spanish team mate will be able to use one more of the medium compound and one less of the softs. Of all drivers, Max is the one with the most softs Pirellis.</p>

<title>Franz Tost: "Disappointing result"</title>
<guid><![CDATA[http://www.verstappen.nl/?locatie=bericht&id=2441&lang=en]]></guid>
<description><![CDATA[<p>Franz Tost, team principle of Scuderia Toro Rosso, felt disappointed after the Australian Grand Prix: "Both drivers did a good start. Max came back from the first lap in 4th position, Carlos was 7th. We kept a fast pace in this first stint. Carlos’ pit-stop went well, by undercutting Massa. After the red flag, when the race was restarted, Max was 5th and Carlos 6th. But in the following laps we lost the pace. Carlos had a lot of front locking.  Therefore we called him for an early pit stop. We changed our strategy and sent him out on medium tires."</p>

<title>Verstappen tenth in hectic Australian GP: "Everything went wrong"</title>
<guid><![CDATA[http://www.verstappen.nl/?locatie=bericht&id=2440&lang=en]]></guid>
<description><![CDATA[<p>Max Verstappen scored his first point of the 2016 Formula 1 season. After a chaotic race, the Dutchman finished the Australian Grand Prix in tenth place. The Scuderia Toro Rosso driver was not able to capitalize on a excellent fifth place on the grid, after a slow second pit stop meant he rejoined the race in a bunged up midfield pack. At the front, Nico Rosberg claimed his fifteenth career win. The race was red flagged but later resumed after a severe crash involving McLaren's Fernando Alonso and Haas' Esteban Gutierrez. Both drivers walked away unharmed.</p>

<p>Straight after the race, Max is clear and concise in his commentary: “The start and first stint went well. But after the second pit stop it all went wrong.” The youngster refers to the miscommunication at the stop. “The tyres weren't ready and after that it became a difficult race. I was quicker than Sainz, throughout the whole race. Nothing was done about that so I know what I need to know.” </p>

<title>James Key: "P5 for Max is an excellent result"</title>
<guid><![CDATA[http://www.verstappen.nl/?locatie=bericht&id=2439&lang=en]]></guid>
<description><![CDATA[<p>James Key, technical director of Scuderia Toro Rosso, says after the qualifying in Melbourne: “There were a lot of unknowns going into today in many respects. Firstly, it was not until today that we were able to run in dry conditions, so there was much to learn for all teams. Secondly, a new qualifying format and finally and most difficult to predict, to know exactly where everyone was, because winter testing is so difficult to predict. I think we did the right thing in free practice by trying to get some race data early on, as many other teams did, because clearly we were missing a lot of information due to yesterday’s weather conditions. This gave us some valuable data for tomorrow.”</p>

<title>Verstappen starts from fifth in first race 2016: "Very happy"</title>
<guid><![CDATA[http://www.verstappen.nl/?locatie=bericht&id=2438&lang=en]]></guid>
<description><![CDATA[<p>Max Verstappen finished in fifth during qualifying in the Australian GP, his best position in his still budding Formula 1-carreer. The Scuderia Toro Rosso-driver starts in Melbourne behind the Mercedes and Ferrari’s, no small feat. Lewis Hamilton snatched pole in the season’s openings race, ahead of his team mate Nico Rosberg.</p>

<p>“It went well. After the last free practice, during which the car’s balance wasn’t optimal, we changed the setup. We made the right choices and I am very happy with a fifth starting position", Max tells Verstappen.nl. “In this new qualifying setup, you only have one chance to do a good lap. There is immediately a lot of pressure on you, which makes it harder for everyone. Our strategy worked out well.”</p>

<title>Torro Rosso behind Mercedes and Ferrari in final practice Melbourne</title>
<guid><![CDATA[http://www.verstappen.nl/?locatie=bericht&id=2437&lang=en]]></guid>
<description><![CDATA[<p>In the run up to the Australian GP, Scuderia Toro Rosso did an excellent job during the third and final free practice. With Max Verstappen in sixth and Carlos Sainz in fourth, the Italian squad was behind the likes of Mercedes and Ferrari as the ‘best of the rest’. Lewis Hamilton once again was at the front, ahead of his German team mate Nico Rosberg.</p>

<p>For the first time, it’s completely dry in Melbourne when the lights turn green for the third free practice. It is as busy as can get, from the word go. In all the commotion the teams were experiencing, in getting their cars on the grid, new kid on the block Rio Haryanto (Manor) and Romain Grosjean (Haas) ran into one another. They hit each other in the pit lane and damaged their cars.</p>

<title>Max plays no part in FP2: "Tricky conditions"</title>
<guid><![CDATA[http://www.verstappen.nl/?locatie=bericht&id=2436&lang=en]]></guid>
<description><![CDATA[<p>Having had an almost rained out first free practice earlier today, the second free practice was also driven in mixed conditions. Max never got round to driving in FP2, as it served no purpose in these conditions. Lewis Hamilton was once again the fastest in the second session, followed by Nico Hülkenberg in the Force India and Kimi Raikkonen in the Ferrari.</p>

<p>Max’ response at the end of the session is short and decisive. He tells Verstappen.nl: “It was a difficult day with tricky conditions. Because of those tricky conditions I wasn’t able to drive a lot, making it hard for me to draw a conclusion after the first day. I hope tomorrow will be dry, so we can finish our schedule and work on the setup of the car.”</p>

<title>Phil Charles: "First day back at school" </title>
<guid><![CDATA[http://www.verstappen.nl/?locatie=bericht&id=2435&lang=en]]></guid>
<description><![CDATA[<p>Phil Charles, chief race engineer of Scuderia Toro Rosso, says after Friday in Melbourne: “First day back at school! I had been looking forward to this day for a while as I expected it would be the first time this year where we would really start to learn where we rank as it is so difficult to judge in winter testing. Unfortunately the famous four-seasons-in-a-day Melbourne weather meant that we didn’t really get to fill in all of those question marks in either session.“</p>

<p>“Carlos had some problems in FP1 so we had to apologise to him after this morning’s session. On the positive side we managed to put those issues aside in FP2 and we managed three decent runs with him on intermediate tyres.”</p>

<title>Max starts off new season in P5 in a rainy Melbourne</title>
<guid><![CDATA[http://www.verstappen.nl/?locatie=bericht&id=2434&lang=en]]></guid>
<description><![CDATA[<p>After a firm debut for Scuderia Toro Rosso in 2015, and preseason testing that went well, Max Verstappen finally kicked off the new Formula 1-season on Friday. The fast Dutchman finished on the Albert Park circuit in fifth during the first free practice. Reigning world champion Lewis Hamilton finished first in his Mercedes. Daniil Kvyat came in second for Red Bull Racing, ahead of his team mate Daniel Ricciardo, who claimed third.</p>

<p>When the lights turn green at the end of the pitlane, for the first time in 2016, it is cloudy and the track is wet. Sebastian Vettel is the first to venture out on the full wets. Max also takes to the track pretty early. For his first installation lap, he has gone out on the intermediates but comes back in after that lap. With a 1:44.037, Nico Rosberg is the first one to put a timed lap down in 2016.</p>

<title>Max looks ahead to Australian GP: "I just can't wait to go back"</title>
<guid><![CDATA[http://www.verstappen.nl/?locatie=bericht&id=2430&lang=en]]></guid>
<description><![CDATA[<p>It’s finally here! The first race weekend of the 2016 season is almost upon us and we are looking forward to the cars driving out on track again at the Albert Park in Melbourne, kicking-off what will be the longest season in the history of Formula 1. Max is ready to return to his STR11 cockpit, in the Australian Grand Prix.</p>

<p>"Last year's Australian GP was a very special weekend for me: I was so excited to be taking part in my first ever Formula 1 Grand Prix! The parts of the circuit that standout for me are turn 1, where you arrive quite fast – or at least that was my feeling back then, as it was all very new to me! – and it's bumpy in the braking area, so I remember that I found it a bit difficult to get the braking right for that turn. Other things I remember was halfway through the lap, when you arrive to turn 10, I could see a lot of fans there, sitting on the grass – they are so passionate and it's so nice to see! At that same point I was also able to see part of the beautiful city.”</p>

<title>Helmut Marko: "Let's see what Max delivers"</title>
<guid><![CDATA[http://www.verstappen.nl/?locatie=bericht&id=2429&lang=en]]></guid>
<description><![CDATA[<p>In an interview with Formula1.com, Red Bull’s motorsport consultant Helmut Marko is asked: at Scuderia Toro Rosso you have two extremely fast youngsters in Max Verstappen and Carlos Sainz. Will running a 2015-spec Ferrari engine slow them down?</p>

<p>“They are happy to have this engine rather than none at all. And I could imagine that they will land in front of Red Bull Racing at the start of the season - probably until midseason - because the power difference is still that significant. In midseason probably the performance will drop, as you cannot further develop the 2015 engine”, replies Marko.</p>
